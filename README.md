# jammer
A Bash script to automate the continuous circular deauthentication of all the wifi networks in your reach

## I am not responsible for any misuses of the script 
Keep in mind that it is generally illegal to use the script at your neihborhood

It is designed for pen-testing purposes

It has only been tested on my two machines, so there may still be bugs that can even cause data loss

### That's why I suggest you take a good look at the code before you execute it

There will be updates as soon as I fix something or make a nice improvement

Not that anyone will see this

```
